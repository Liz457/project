            <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> In OOP, we can restrict the access to the
                    variables abd methods - that is called Encapsulation. This will prevent the data from being modified
                    accidentally.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Inheritance:</strong> There are two types of inheritance: single
                    inheritance and multiple inheritance.<br>
                    You can have a child class and a parent class. The child inherits all the properties from the
                    parents class.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Polymorphism means multiple forms.We can find
                    the same operator or function taking multiple forms. It is also useful in creating
                    different classes which will have class methods with same name. That helps in re-using a lot of code
                    and decreases code complexity.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Abstraction is used to hide the internal
                    functionality of the function from the users. The users only interact with the basic implementation
                    of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is familiar with that "what function does" but
                    they don't know "how it does." The Calculator code does the same thing. It hides the internal
                    functionalities from the user. The user will only know the calculations.
