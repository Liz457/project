                Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into
                containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating
                system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Developers can
                create containers without Docker, but the platform makes it easier, simpler, and safer to build, deploy
                and manage containers. Docker is essentially a toolkit that enables developers to build, deploy, run,
                update, and stop containers using simple commands and work-saving automation through a single API.
            </p>

            <h5>Containers:</h5>
            <p>
                A Docker container is nothing but an environment virtualized during run-time to allow users to isolate
                applications from
                the system underpinning it. These containers are compact, portable units in which you can start up an
                application quickly and easily. Containers are different than Virtual Machine that they deploy a
                different level of virtualization. Unlike VMs where virtualization takes place in the hardware,
                containers are virtualized in the app layer.
            </p>

            <h5>Images:</h5>
            <p>
                A docker image is an immutable file that contains all the dependencies required to run an application
                correctly. As images cannot be changed, they are also called snapshots. Since images are mere templates,
                they cannot be run on their own. You can use the image as a foundation to build a container. Once the
                container has been created, an editable layer is added on the top of the image, meaning you can modify
                the newly created copy of the image. Docker images can have a series of layers, each of which differs,
                but also originates from, the previous one. These layers are immutable files to which a container layer
                can be added once you use them to build a virtual environment.
