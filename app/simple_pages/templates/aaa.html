                    AAA testing stands for Arrange-Act-Assert.
               </p>
                <p>
                    AAA patterns suggests that you should divide your test method into three sections: arrange, act and
                    assert. Each one of them only responsible for the part in which they are named after. So the arrange
                    section you only have code required to set up that specific test. Then there is the Act, which
                    should be the invocation of the method being tested. And on Assert you would simply check whether
                    the expectations were met.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is useful because AAA pattern helps you keep your unit tests well-structured, clean and
                    readable. This pattern stays the same, regardless of what you are mocking. It creates a clear
                    separation between a testâ€™s setup, operations, and results. It also enforces a certain degree of
                    discipline when you write your tests. The well-defined structure makes the code easier to read and
                    understand. If you place the steps in order and format your code to separate them, you can scan a
                    test and quickly comprehend what it does.
